							<strong>Applause for a Cause</strong> is a philanthropic production company that
							writes, produces, edits, directs, and premieres a feature film (90
							minutes or longer) every year in order to raise money for that year’s
							selected charity. Applause for a Cause was founded on the idea that we
							can do what we love to do and benefit a deserving beneficiary in the
							process.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section id="story">
						<h1>The Story</h1>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								It all began in the fall of 2010 when two Northwestern University
								students decided that they wanted to push the boundaries of student
								filmmaking. Sarah Jane Inwards and Alec Ziff embarked on a mission
								to make a feature-length film (90 minutes or longer) and choose a
								charity that would receive all of the proceeds. While the process
								would be strenuous, that did not stop them. Applause for a Cause was
								born.
							</p>
							<p>
								With the help of NU Channel 1, Inwards and Ziff led a team of 70 students (from
								freshman to seniors) who acted in, wrote, produced, edited, and directed
								Applause for a Cause's first feature. Over 300 moviegoers attended the red
								carpet premiere of <em>RUΣH</em> on May 20th, 2011. Applause raised over $1,500 for the
								Ronald McDonald House near Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>But that was only the beginning.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								Applause for a Cause is here to stay, currently in production on its second
								feature, <em>Experience For Beginners</em>, the proceeds from which will benefit the
								Make-A-Wish Foundation. Applause now encompasses more students, a larger budget,
								and its own equipment. Yet Applause’s vision remains the same: students have the
								power to create professional, industry-quality films while doing so for a
								greater good.

							<h2>RUΣH <span class="gray">2011</span></h2>
							<p>
								Applause for a Cause produced the feature film <em>RUΣH</em> in the
								2010-2011 academic year. <em>RUΣH</em> is a comedy about six college freshman
								rushing fraternities and sororities, only to have their relationships
								change forever. Over 300 people attended the red carpet premiere of <em>RUΣH</em> on May 20th, 2011 and helped raise $1,500 for the Ronald McDonald
								House near Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
