I'm on the executive board of Northwestern student group Applause For a Cause as publicity head. I decided this would be the perfect opportunity to make the organization's first website to help publicize this year's film and establish them as a student group on campus.

This is also my first attempt at a one-page website.

Visit the site at http://www.applausenu.org/
